## ABOUT ##
Hello there, this is my Discord/Twitch bot. The main idea was to merge 2 differents .NET Console API into one. 
By doing this, Twitch can interact with Discord and fully log the chat into a room, or give special rewards on Discord based on Twitch sub.

STILL WIP until I really work on in. Can be seen on my Twitch : twitch.tv/Kitarsh
